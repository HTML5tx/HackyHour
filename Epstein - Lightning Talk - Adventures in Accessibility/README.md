Adventures in Accessibility

We talked about a different way of "seeing" the sites we develop. To practice, look at your own website, or a website you frequently use, and look for the information that is trying to be communicated, what on the page is or is not information *given that context*, and ask yourself if it is in a form that everyone can use, understand, and work with. 

Use your imagination, work through the 5 senses (okay, given the state of current technology, sight and sound are sufficient, but remember that use of a sense is a gradient, not just an on/off situation), keep focused not on everything that happens to be present, but on whether that information is available.  For a flipped perspective, I offer the example of a joke told in ASL on YouTube for something that would not be accessible to most attendees.
