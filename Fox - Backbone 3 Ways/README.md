Backbone: 3 Ways
=========

---------

Find an old project of yours that has a RESTful API (or close to one). Use Backbone to model the data and render the views.

(If you don't have an old project, create a new one using the framework of your choice. There are lots of RESTful examples out there ([bbcrd's REST API example](https://github.com/bbcrd/REST-API-example), [twilio's Flask-RESTful](https://github.com/twilio/flask-restful), [tomchristie's Django REST framework](https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework)), so you don't have to start from scratch).
